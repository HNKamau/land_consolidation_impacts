  # Farmers are at a high risk of diseases, and stress from higher exposure to farm related accidents, air pollution and pesticides David et al.2021 (https://doi.org/10.3390/su132011384). Conversely, Active lifestyles through working on farm has been associated with a reduction in health costs. For instance, Aoyagi & Shephard 2012 (https://doi.org/10.2165/11590530-000000000-00000) found a 3.7% reduction, and Sato et al. 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2019.12.009) a 0.4% in 2 years and 1% in 3 years.

StiernstrÃ¶m et al. 1998 (https://doi.org/10.1097/00043764-199810000-00013) found that non-farmers had higher rates of hospital admissions than farmers within the same rural setting.

Nevertheless, according to the Murang'a CIDP 2018, rural self employment opportunities are increasing with increasing expansion of towns and market centres. Additionally, the the Murang'a people have on average of 9 years in education with a maximum of 19 years and about 88% of the households can read and write Kamau et al. 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2017.12.014).

  # social cohesion benefit
  # social cohesion is expressed as a factor of free time as a result of the the intervention. With the intervention, free time is associated with social cohesion through community participation and involvement. However, social cohesion can e disrupted by urbanization of the rural areas and migration. Urbanization, free time, and alternative work can threaten social cohesion and lead to anti-social behaviors e.g crime, drug use, theft and domestic conflict. Migration from rural to urban areas can also result into rural hollowing  Wang et al. 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.105146). They take up time that would otherwise be used for community cooperation or activities. We quantify it by the cost of labor per hour.

  # Childhood benefit
  # Small scale farming employ family labor including children to help with farm labor which reduces the overall production costs. Scholars argue that when children are involved in such activities, they lose the opportunity to just being children and enjoy childhood. Land consolidation, allows for childhood benefit. To determine this benefit, we determined the number of hours a child(ren) contribute(s) to family farm labor weekly. The value of childhood benefit was equated to the value of hiring labor (wage/hour)
