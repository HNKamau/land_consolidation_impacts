**Modeling the impacts of a farmer joining a land consolidation program and of a government investing in the project**

Hannah Kamau

Farmers are often faced by many farm related decisions. Most are risky and involve  partial or an overhaul of their farming activities. 
Interplay of factors like socio-cultural, economic, political and environmental influence and sway the decisions that they make. Some of 
the decisions do not return a decent profit margin for them, leaving them worse off. Presently, the farmers are facing with a decision of 
whether or not to join a land consolidation program aimed at improving their livelihood and curtailing further subdivision of land. 
To better understand whether to join in or not we decided to use decision analysis approach where we mapped out the pathways of the decision
and its likely outcome(s). We also identified risks and their extent of reducing the benefits or increasing the costs. In this document,
we write a mathematical code that takes into account the change from their current practice to id they joined the land consolidation program.
We evaluate the worthiness of the decision by quantifying the return discounted for 25 years. We also identify variables that if addressed would
impact the success of the decision.
