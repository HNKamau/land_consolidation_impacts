**Modeling the impacts of a farmer joining a land consolidation program and of a government investing in the project**

Farmers are often faced by many farm related decisions. Most of the decisions are risky and involve  partial or an overhaul of their farming activities. Interplay of factors like socio-cultural, economic, political and environmental influence and sway the decisions that farmers make. Some of the decisions do not return a decent profit margin for the farmers, leaving them worse off. Presently, the farmers are faced with the decision of whether to join a land consolidation program aimed at improving their livelihood and addressing further subdivision of land. To support their decision making, we decided to use Decision Analysis approach, where we mapped out the pathways of the decision to consolidate land and its likely outcome(s). We also identified risks and their extent of reducing the benefits or increasing the costs. In this document, we write a series of equations that takes into account the changes from their current practice to if they joined the land consolidation program. We evaluate the worthiness of the decision by simulating outcomes for 25 years. We also identify variables that, if addressed, would impact the success of the decision.
